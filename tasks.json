The tile is viewed from an orthogonal top-down view with zero vanishing points and no perspective depth, completely flat 2D tilemap. The floor is a soft warm beige-tan base (#D9C7A3) with a subtle repeating pixel pattern suggesting clean stone or ceramic tiles: small 2\u20133 pixel speckles in slightly darker tan (#C3B08F) and lighter cream (#E8D9BE) scattered evenly. Add faint square tile seams: 1-pixel-wide lines forming a 2\u00d72 sub-grid inside the 32\u00d732 tile, seams in slightly darker tan (#B79F78), kept low-contrast so it doesn\u2019t overpower gameplay. Corners and all four edges must match perfectly for seamless tiling; pattern density remains consistent at edges. Features bold black outlines only where needed for tiny cracks/speckles (no heavy outlines around the tile perimeter). Flat colors, no gradients, no shadows, no lighting effects; clean edges suitable for sprite extraction. The image is fully filled by the floor texture (no extra background).",

The wall fills the entire 32\u00d732 tile, with an internal brick pattern: 2 rows of large bricks (each brick about 12\u201314 pixels wide, 8\u201310 pixels tall), offset like a running bond; mortar lines are 1\u20132 pixels thick. Add 3\u20135 small chips/cracks as 1-pixel notches along brick edges for texture. All four edges must tile seamlessly so that adjacent wall tiles connect with continuous brick/mortar pattern; no visible seams.

Add a few small nicks: 1\u20132 pixel chips on edges. All four edges must tile seamlessly if many destructible tiles are adjacent; avoid unique corner markings that would break repetition, keep the plank seams and cross-brace aligned so repeats look intentional.

The map is a 16\u00d716 grid of 32\u00d732 tiles (total 512\u00d7512). Use only the three tile visuals defined by the tileset assets: empty floor (warm beige), indestructible wall (cool gray-blue bricks), destructible wall (warm orange-brown crate/wood). Composition requirements: (1) Outer border is a continuous ring of indestructible wall tiles on all edges. (2) Interior indestructible walls form a readable maze pattern with evenly spaced pillars: place indestructible wall blocks at every other tile in a checker-like pillar arrangement (classic Bomberman feel), ensuring lanes and corners. (3) Destructible walls populate many corridor spaces but leave a safe spawn pocket: top-left corner spawn area is open floor for a 3\u00d73 region (tiles (1..3,1..3) in grid coordinates excluding border), and additionally keep the adjacent right and down corridor tiles clear for immediate movement. (4) Ensure at least 3 distinct open lanes connecting across the map, with choke points and corners; destructible walls should create breakable pathways but not fully seal off large regions. Color scheme must remain consistent: floors warm and clean, indestructible walls cool and sturdy, destructible walls warm and breakable. Technical: crisp pixel edges, no gradients, no shadows or lighting effects. The entire canvas is filled by the tilemap; no extra background.",
